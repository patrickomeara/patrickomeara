Hey, I'm Pat.

I'm a Software Engineer, I usually write Typescript and PHP, and usually use React, TanStack, React Native, Expo and Laravel.

I contribute to and advocate for Open Source Software.

Most of the time I'm hacking on [Maintainly.com](https://maintainly.com) or hanging with my kids.

I also run [PHPxMEL](https://phpxmel.com).

You can follow me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/patrickomeara.bsky.social) and reluctantly still on [Twitter](https://x.com/patomeara)
