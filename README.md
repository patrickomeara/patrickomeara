## Hi, I’m Pat.

I’m a software engineer focused on building modern web and mobile applications. My day-to-day stack includes TypeScript, PHP, React, TanStack, React Native, Expo, and Laravel.

I actively contribute to open source projects and advocate for open collaboration and better developer tools.

Most of my time goes into [Maintainly.com](https://maintainly.com), a CMMS platform I help build, or spending time with my kids.

I also run [PHPxMEL](https://phpxmel.com), a PHP-focused meetup based in Melbourne.

You can find me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/patrickomeara.bsky.social) or still, somewhat reluctantly, on [Twitter](https://x.com/patomeara).
